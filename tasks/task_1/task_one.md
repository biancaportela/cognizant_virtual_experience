# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Here is your task

## Step 1: Prepare

Note: This task assumes that you are able to access Google Colab. This will require you to have or create a free Google account. 

First, you must download the CSV file provided within the additional resources (sample_sales_data.csv). This task will make use of coding notebooks, specifically using Python, which provide an interactive way of running and sharing code. There are 2 notebooks provided (eda.ipynb & eda_walkthrough.ipynb), “eda.ipynb” provides some code snippets to get started but will then assume that the user is able to use their knowledge to perform analysis on the data in Python. “eda_walkthrough.ipynb” provides the same code snippets, but also provides a walkthrough guide on how to complete this task. We recommend that if you’re comfortable with Python and data analysis, use “eda.ipynb”, otherwise use “eda_walkthrough.ipynb”. Furthermore, you can run this notebook however you wish, but we recommend that you use “Google Colaboratory” (Google Colab). A video link is provided in the additional resources covering a getting started guide with Google Colab, as well as how to import a dataset into Google Colab. This should take 10-15 minutes.

## Step 2: Exploration

Now that you’re ready to dive into the data, you should use the notebooks provided to conduct your exploratory data analysis. Try to use a rigorous and scientific approach when analyzing data. Always ask yourself this question: what do these results mean? You should aim to have a solid understanding of the statistical properties of the dataset when you’re complete (this may include the distributions of columns, descriptive statistics such as mean, median, max and min, etc.) By the end of the exploration, you should feel comfortable with the dataset and what it means. This should take you 25-30 minutes.

## Step 3: Communication

Finally, you must summarize your findings in a concise and business-friendly manner within an email to the Data Science team leader. This email should also contain recommendations for what else we require in order to complete this task for the client. Please draft your email in a word document and submit this file for review. You can use the template provided in the additional resources section. This should take 5-10 minutes.
