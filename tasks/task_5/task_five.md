# The case

The ML engineering team has taken your Python module and deployed the algorithm into production along with the DevOps, which is great!

Before it goes live, the DevOps team has been collecting some predictions from the algorithm and has provided these to the ML engineering team, who have performed some testing of the predictions against the actual results for ‘estimated_stock_pct’. The ML engineering team were testing the predictions vs actual results to see how well the algorithm is performing on “live” data.

After performing the tests, the ML engineering team wants to discuss with you some questions about the algorithm in order to further improve the model before the DevOps team integrates it with Gala Groceries’ live system.

# Here is your task

## Step 1: Prepare

If you need to, remind yourself of the algorithm that you built and the code that you wrote. The ML engineering team will most likely be asking questions about how to improve the model, so you may want to do some research about how you can improve the performance of your model. If you need some support, take a look at the additional resources. This should take 10-15 minutes. 

## Step 2: Answer questions

To complete this task, answer the multiple-choice quiz. Please note there are 6 multiple choice questions to complete in this task. Please be patient as each question loads. This should take 10-20 minutes.
